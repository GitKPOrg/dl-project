Hi team, Kartek Pallerla (KP) here.!!

Duplicate the .ipynb (Notebook) File named **20251126_22.47_KP_DL_Project_ColabNotebook** to create your own notebook file.
Rename the duplicated notebook (ideas or best tips for renaming: Use time stamp and your initials of your name followed by file name. For example: My notebook is called **20251126 22.47 KP DL Project Colab Notebook**)
Use this notebook that you renamed to conduct your project activities (like loading pre-processed data, coding, model/algorithm setup, training, testing, evaluating, etc).
The detailed instructions are within the notebook (.ipynb) file itself. Please check it out.

Thanks Team!
