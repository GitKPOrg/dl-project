This is by far the best one I've found. I have very dry, thick, wavy hair. I know people are complaining about the alcohol that didn't used to be in this hair conditioner, but that doesn't effect my hair at all. Infact it improves mine. The reason why I like it so much is because it really smoothed and hydrates the heck out of my hair. I put it on for 10-15 minutes in my shower and then rinse it. It makes my hair so smoothe and silky feeling. Also, the scent us yummy smelling, I don't know why no one likes it. My husband especially loves it. 😉",5.0,2,4,en

"Large, stiff, awkward to hold and overstuffed. — I know that loofahs take a while to break in, but I think this product has other issues. I'm a woman with smaller hands. This is just too oversized for me. It's difficult to hold and control. It's also overstuffed with a very convex surface, so only the center of the raised area actually touches my body. It doesn't mold itself to the surface of my skin, so I feel like I'm scrubbing in thin lines, and it doesn't really do the job in the dips and grooves a human body has because of that. It does dries quickly, even though I don't have anything to hang it off of. I'm pretty disappointed with this order and I can't recommend this product.",2.0,0,1,en

"Very strong scent at first, but it disappears very quickly. — I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne ""Les Enfants"" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or",3.0,1,2,en

"Not bad for my 3c natural hair — I used to use Pantene Women of Color Conditioner (or whatever it's called) back when I was relaxed and in the beginning of my natural hair journey. I ended up switching to a different conditioner that was cheaper and it actually ended up being more effective, so I haven't used Pantene probably in 2 years.<br /><br />I read about the Truly Natural line and I was a little hesitant about trying it due to past experience with it not adding much moisture to my hair. I heard good things about it so I decided to give the co-wash a shot, hoping it'd be a cheaper alternative to the As I Am Coconut cowash.<br /><br />I soaked my hair in the shower, used a palm sized amount, focusing on my scalp first as I usually do, then started finger detangling the rest of my hair. I'll have to admit, the slip is pretty good! This stuff really melted my strands and made finger detangling a breeze - which is most important for me in a conditioner. I also like how thick the product is. When I slathered this on each section, my hair felt coated and moisturized, but not too thick that I had a hard time rinsing it out.<br /><br />Now when I rinsed it out, my hair still felt soft, but not as soft as I'd like. Also, the scent does smell good, but it's just a tiny bit overpowering, which doesn't surprise me since it's Pantene.",4.0,2,3,en

"Overall a great trimmer with 1 exception — I've been using a Norelco beard trimmer for years. I bought the first T100 which used 2 AA batteries. I've seen the improvements over the years and they have definitely added to how well the products functioned. Right off the bat I'll tell you my exception. This beard trimmer was made in China. That might not matter at all to some and you are entitled to your opinion. But it matters to me and I was slightly disappointed to see that they are not being made in Austria anymore.<br /><br />Other than that, I am impressed with this trimmer. The turbo vacuum system works great. I have not had to clean my bathroom sink even once. The self-sharpening blades no longer need to be lubricated with oil. Ever though this unit is slightly bigger than my last one (T990)it is not more awkward in my hands. Even the Accu Control System's flexing guide comb is easier to clean than the last one.<br /><br />I do have to recharge the battery after 2 or 3 uses but it does have a quick charge feature that takes about 1 hour. So I can't really complain about that.<br /><br />I have not noticed any problems with actually trimming my beard. The 9 lockable length settings have not slipped for me as others have reported (I am currently using a number 4). I have not had any problems with trimming under my nose but I have been used to using a Norelco.<br",4.0,2,3,en

It is a HUGE overstatement, maybe a lie, to say it reduces the appearance of a bruise. If you want to hide a bruise, get a concealer! I've tried many things to hasten the healing time from chopped parsley, heat, messaging, arnica, a banana peel, and rubbing the bruise with a warm hard boiled egg. In my experience, the only real cure is to wait it out, usually ten days until a bruise will fade. I'm not saying heladerm doesn't help heal the bruise.

My hands get so irritated and inflamed that they really pain me. I can use steroids at times to get in under control, but she put me on to Acid Mantle as well. Love it. Really works and helps my skin heal and stay moisturized. When my hands are paining me, I put some on and the pain starts to go away. A-Mantle can be pretty expensive at the pharmacy, but I've found it to be reasonably priced at Amazon, and I'm sure other websites. Highly recommend for any dry skin or even Eczema.",5.0,2,4,en

"Love How My Teeth Feel — There was a definite learning curve for this. I’ve never owned either an electric toothbrush, or a water flosser. First time out with the flosser, I got all wet. I had to Google how to use one. Apparently, it is a messy ordeal unless you’re very, very careful. After the first couple of uses, I had the same issue referenced by other reviewers, that the water pressure would randomly be very low. It seems the rubber seal that connects the tank to the inner workings of the machine does “grab” properly. I’ve found that by taking the end of a standard toothbrush and gently pressing down on the seal before turning it on results in a machine that works normally every time. I LOVE LOVE LOVE how water flossing, combined with the electric toothbrush leave my teeth! The difference between this and just a standard toothbrush is palpable. In fact, combined with the fact that I was 25 the first time I saw a dentist, I’m surprised I haven’t rotted my teeth out at this point. It’s addictive how clean my teeth feel! Oral hygiene has never been something I think about, it was just been something I had to do. Now I actually look forward to it, just so I can run my tongue over my teeth to feel how clean they feel.",4.0,2,3,en

"Longest wearing lip — So I saw this on IG and as an oily person who is always messing with her dry lips, I've been looking for a true long wear lip formula. And I have to say, this truly lasts all day with little wear. I wore this on a date with my boyfriend, it lasted through dinner and a movie, but it did not last through the rest of the evening, wink wink. That was to be expected.<br /><br />Also, I found I am able to get multiple uses out of one stick. I cut open one side of the plastic, when I'm done applying I slide the stick back inside and it's good for a few more uses. Full disclosure, I don't use a ton of layers, just 2 or 3.<br /><br />This is pretty drying, fyi.<br /><br />What else? I think that's it. For nine bucks it's worth a shot.

"Lemony face wash 🍋 — I just washed my face with this Sia C + Lemon Peel wash. It lathered nicely in my hands and on my face. It has a soft lemony scent. It rinsed well - and this is where you'll feel the difference. You know the phrase 'squeaky clean'? That's what you'll feel. There's absolutely no residue left behind. If you've used Noxema to wash your face, it has a similar effect. Because I'm prone to dry skin, I had to apply cream immediately. The label on the bottle suggests washing with this, then using a toner, followed by Vitamin C. Makes sense as your skin is stripped of everything and is ready for some TLC. I think this is an ideal wash for people with oily or combination skin. For me, this will be a great summer wash to control the shine (oil). If you're skin is dry like mine, then moisturize immediately after using.",5.0,2,4,en

The packaging is great, you get a big pack of the facial cleansing wipes and five of the face masks, and it all feels great on your skin.<br />My skin was softer after the mask. I suggest warming it first - I tossed it in its package right into my hot bath, along with the eye gel mask. The mask can be a little drippy ( they usually are), so soaking in the bath with it on means no clean up.<br />The lip treatment was great! My lips were a little dry and peeling, and after the treatment, they were so soft and moisturized.<br />Nothing had any unpleasant fragrances, either.

"Love It! — I have problems with my hair falling out all the time. I am not sure whether it falls out from the medication I am taking, the medical problem, or the years of processing my hair. However, after going to the dermatologist(with much success), the next year I tried certain products on my hair and it fell out again. I started using Carol's Daughter and those products seem to make my hair grow;yet, the minute I try something new it falls out again. So, I searched the internet for homemade remedies for hair loss. I found a wonderful site which provides all sorts of home remedies with regular products in your kitchen cabinet, medicine cabinet, and refrigerator. One of the recommendations were castor oil. So, I decided to search amazon (my favorite site)and found Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment. I received the oil within a week of ordering it. I have only been using the product for a couple of days, so I can not give a review on hair growth yet. However, I will say that I love the texture of the product, and the smell is not as bad as some of the reviews that I read. I guess it depends on your sense of smell. I personally like the smell and it makes my hair soft and it feels wonderful! I am African American with natural coil type hair.

"You can wear this for days. — If you're looking for a lip product that really, truly only needs to be applied once a day, this is it. This is my second LipTint from LA Splash (The other was Bellatrix/Belladonna) and both of these have stayed on my lips through 48 hours of wear until I decided to remove them. They lasted through eating, drinking, talking, sleeping, showering, exercising, and just about any other task you can expect to do throughout a day.<br /><br />If you've never used an LA-Splash LipTint, the first thing you're going to say about them is that they're super drying. I've found that the drying effect is really what keeps this stuff attached to your lips until you decide to remove it. My best advice is to keep your lips in good condition before its use. When I do this, my lips don't get that cracked appearance people tend to complain about when using LA-Splash LipTints. They look more like the advertised picture. When I remove it, I do a lip scrub and put on a little more lip balm and my lips are as good as new.

I am every bit as enamored with this set as I was with the original set that I purchased. This set came with peppermint and tea treel soap as well as a bar of snowflake soap. The soaps are wonderfully luxurious. They are bubbly and refreshing and hydrating to the skin. They are super highly scented. The scrub this tome is thepeppermint latte scrub. It a a very nice scrub, but Oddly i think I prefer th scent of the vanilla latte better.<br />Decadent. Indulgent. Beautiful. Just some of the words that come to mind with this product. I have used the scrub before and it is such a wonderful scrub from the scent to the feeling of it towhat it does to the skin. I was so excited to try this particular kit. When it arrived i wasn't sure if i wanted to use it. Afterall it is so attratively wrapped i could have used it as a present. That lasted 2 days. I just couldn't resist trying the soap and hard lotion.<br />The soap is wonderfully moisturizing and leaves behind a subtle fragrnce on your skin. I have used other hard lotions and love them.

The only downfall is that you really need to be an expert using liquid eyeliner. I am not. So practice makes perfect. Every time gets better. When applying, a magnetic 'chunk' will sometimes appear and will throw your line off. Removal is easy, but not super quick.

One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage. So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it.

So I came across this Bundle Monster set and looked through the reviews. I thought it was too good to be true that such good quality could come from something so cheap, and boy was I right<br /><br />The plates came in one thick stack in a plastic bag inside a mailer. They were not separated by any protective plastic or papers or anything, much like a stack of new mirrors would come packaged. They were just all in one big stack of plates. I tried peeling at the plate, hoping some protective plastic would peel off.<br /><br />I grabbed some special polish, applied it to the design and tried to stamp. When I scraped off the excess, hardly any polish remained in the plate, and it didn't go smoothly. When I scraped it down, it sounded like it was being scratched. I looked at all the plates before using, and they were COVERED in thick, nasty scratches, as if someone took sharp rocks and scratched up the plates.<br /><br />Either I didn't receive a new set, or they were damaged by scratching against each other in transit. Even the plate on the top was scratched, so it couldn't have been scratched by another. I am very VERY disappointed. I have always gotten good products from Amazon, but this was",1.0,0,0,en

"Does a passable job — I have long been under the impression, from the experience of others and just as a general idea, that while electric shavers can be good, they will never be able to fully complete with a manual razor. That being said, I didn't expect this device to be as good as a traditional razor. It isn't. It does ok getting most of the major scruff off and the big benefits are that it safes both money (no shaving cream needed) and you don't really have to worry about those pesky cuts. That's the big one for me. It is also easy to clean and feels very sturdy. There's nothing about it that indicates that you'd expect it to be a cheap as the price. There are a few trade-offs. It takes a little longer than a traditional shave as that you have to go over the areas a few times. The cut is decent but not as clean as a manual razor.

Both fabrics on the inside and out are washable and actually removes the self tanner lotion unlike other gloves I have tried before. I love how the mitt comes with a little loop so I can hang it on a hook, making it easy to keep it in great condition by air drying it and keeping it hygienically safe, as hanging it keeps it away from germs from other things around my home.

"Pretty natural looking — Finally, after over a year of having these, I actually tried them out! I’ve never worn false lashes before and was hesitant to use them (obviously since I’ve had them a year without using them - lol!). I’ve seen so many false eyelashes that are so crazy over-the-top obviously fake looking. These are not that way at all. You get a generous supply of them (see photos) and they are reusable too. With the rate I’m going, mine should last forever!<br />I don’t have get up close vision so it was a little bit harder for me to apply them than it would be for someone who can see better. I used a magnifying makeup mirror though and did fine. The photos of the eyelash after it was applied was my first attempt ever to do this so it’s definitely not perfect but it was much easier to apply than I expected it to be. I am sure my results will improve with practice. These are secured in place with magnetic eyeliner (I guess I am pretty ignorant about these things but I had never heard of that!). The eyeliner goes on smoothly; actually better than some liquid eyeliner that I’ve used in the past. It’s a little tricky to get them in the best spot. Like I said previously though, I think this will get much easier the more times I try them. It comes with tweezers to use but it was almost easier for me to apply them without using",5.0,2,4,en

"Meh — I have a relatively small head circumference, so I purchased this shower cap in March 2022 in hopes that this design would offer a better water seal and less gaps that get my hair wet in the water. I specifically thought the bow on the front would tighten to constrict the cap a bit. Well.<br /><br />I’m writing this review in June 2022, after 3 months of typical wear, to report that the front half of the elastic band has come unglued and hangs across my forehead unless I tuck it up in the cap with my hair. The bow on front does not offer any tightening—it does relax the tightness around your head if you need a bit more room.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not impressed. It’s a $20 shower cap that functions mostly the same as the super cheap ones you can get at your local big box store.

My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.",3.0,1,2,en

"A true disappointment! — Garbage! To start with It's very beautiful,and it does have the mirror effect until you put the topcoat on, I've tried it both ways with and without the topcoat, with the topcoat on it loses it's mirror effect( as the label on the box states,but it's not stated in the advertisement of this product), It dulls the effect of the mirrored look, the topcoat just makes it look like regular silver polish,without the topcoat it's beautiful it has that mirror effect,but only lasted about ten minutes if that,once you wash your hands or rub against something it's gone , so wearing it out without the topcoat is a definite no, no it will not last two hours as it's states on the box ,because I was able to peel it off soon after it was applied and cured from the entire nail, This product is to expensive for it to not deliver,I will never buy this or anything with this brand Mia Secret on the label again..

Arrived in excellent condition. Very gorgeous — If you are looking for decently inexpensive flower clips that will arrive in excellent condition you cannot go wrong with the seller YOUBAMI. It was packaged very well and arrived in a box. All flowers were in tact and just like other reviewers pictures. They are exactly as described. If you want a big flower then get the 3 inchers but these were fine for me and my family. Not a huge POP but a good enough pop to be noticed. Excellent condition and color. There is a trick to putting these behind your ear. I like to pull out my hair sideways and put the clip on sideways closest to my ear so that it doesn't stick directly up. my mom used hers on her bag and a few of my cousins put the flower in their bun. Very happy I went with YOUBAMI. BTW these are alligator clips.,5.0,2,4,en

But all the store offerings I tried had really cheap artificial-smelling scents that I hate: coconut, almond, vanilla, cooking herbs, or Fake-O fruits scents that smell like Koolaid flavors. Even the ones billed as &#34;floral&#34; had one or more or those scents in it.

I can’t believe it!! I pretty much gave up on natural deodorants before I took a chance on this one and I’m so glad that I did. For my health and my family I will be switching to Beauty By Earth for good. Thank you so much for making such a lovely wonderful product. You have a new customer for life!",5.0,2,4,en

Great product for all.! — Ordered this for my 13 year old niece. She is in that stage where she wants to shave her legs and cries every time her mom does wax for her upper lip. I have the silk n go but didn’t want to spend that much on a machine if I didn’t have to. I did a lot of researched and. And across this. I loved that it comes with goggles as safety is important. One thing I liked about it as I had to test it myself to see if it works is rush you don’t always have to press the button you just move to another area. It has the levels and she can start low and work her way up. And you can smell the hair burning which means it is working. It doesn’t sting or hurt like wax so I am sure she is going to be relieved and it for sure beats the over 1k for 10 times that I have went and done in my arms before and paid the money and they still grew back and I would come home after the session like a spotted cheetah. I will upset one I give it to her for her birthday and she tries it out but I am sure she is going to be happy she doesn’t have to wax as my sister is anti shaving :),5.0,2,4,en
"Not quite as it was pictured — The description states this is a high quality women's wig and the picture seems to show that as well. The blonde wig that I received is not what I expected, based on the listing. The hair quality was okay - although not quite as realistic as the picture. The wig was adjustable and felt okay while I was wearing it. However, there was not any way that I could arrange the wig that the weave of the skull cap did not show. So, the only way that I could wear this wig was with a hat, scarf, or headband. I was not expecting as high of a quality as the listing indicates, but I was expecting to be able to wear it by itself. I am disappointed.<br /><br />I received this item free in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback. The price I paid had no bearing on my review, as I have no relationship to the seller and I never guarantee a good review.",2.0,0,1,en

"Cremo is great, but different — I note some of the negative reviews here with interest. I am not sure that they are written in good faith, but on the assumption that they are, one complaint that I can relate to is that Cremo does not lather and that it does not shave as well as some other shaving soaps and creams. I initially had a similar reaction when I first started to use Cremo but that changed with experience, as I relate below.<br /><br />I have to feel that these negative reviews are probably due to the user not knowing how to work with the product and not knowing what to expect. Cremo is not a high lathering (or even much of a low lathering) cream. If used correctly (or even incorrectly for that matter) you will definitely not get a nice white Barbasol cloud of foam on your face. What you will get is a very light, essentially transparent, coating of highly slick lubricant. And that is the other thing: with Cremo you need to use a lot (I mean a lot) of water. In fact you need to use a ratio of something like 20:1 water to product. The more water, the better, even if you think you are using so much that you are essentially washing the product off your face (you aren't). This stuff is very highly concentrated.<br /><br />As stated above, I am somewhat sympathetic to the negative reviews since it took me a while to warm up to Cremo",5.0,2,4,en

"Nice size. Easy operation. Effective curling function. 👍👍 — Of course the first thing that the significant other noticed about the product is the pink coloring. She said it goes perfectly with her other hair/beauty products. So, already it has a head start.<br />It comes inside a nice, somewhat snug drawstring bag. This is useful for transporting the curling device. And, yes, the compact size makes it very sensible to pack for remote (away from home) usage. Another key aspect of the product is wireless operation. Evidence: she comments that not having to worry about wires or being close to the wall outlet is fantastic. And, not dealing with power cords means better time efficiency.<br />Operation is fairly easy. A long press of the power button turns it on. When you press the power button again, you advance to a feature you can alter/select, with that aspect blinking. For example, the ""R"" might be blinking. You use the +/- button to change it to ""L"" (R and L indicate the curling direction, creating right or left curls). In this manner, you can change the direction, temperature and timer. The display also shows the battery power status. When the curler device has reached proper temperature, it beeps. You can then insert a small section of hair. Curling appearance/tightness will depend on hair texture, temperature and time of treatment.<br />The battery capacity is rated at 5000mAh. It takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery. This affords 4 - 6 hours of continuous operating time.<br",5.0,2,4,en

"Nightmare to get activated! — If you install before your old payroll runs out, too bad so sad, you lose whatever part of the year you still had.

I didn't have the card handy that was on the current license and it hadn't expired so I didn't expect them to refuse to activate until I had a full number. So, I had to get a new CC just so I could activate the software.<br />Even though they were still billing the old card monthly for the extra employees. Once you give them your cc number they automatically bill you for the full Quickbooks AND the payroll next year unless you call and cancel the purchase. And then to use the retail license from Amazon when you buy it you have to call again. and if you decide to wait on the payroll part if it expires later, you have to call AGAIN. It is maddening to do this every year. You save some money but you spend time. So, if you are busy and billing time, you won't find this saves you anything and the frustration is high.

"AWESOME PRODUCT! EASY TO USE! NO BURNS! — I just received this KINDOMCARES hair straightening comb today and I was so excited I could not wait to try it. The comb itself is of high quality and comes packaged very nicely. It has an on/off button and six heat settings depending on the weight, curl and thickness of your hair. My hair is color treated, slightly wavy with medium thickness so I used the middle setting (3 to 4). The device heated up in under a minute and is cool to the touch as the heating element is not exposed to the outer edge of the comb. I found that starting from the underside of my hair gave me more control than just combing it down my head. I was able to straighten my whole head in under 5 minutes. I love that I cannot burn myself which is my main complaint about hair straightening irons. Also, I was able to get my hair straight without hearing it sizzle as I did not need as much heat. I am posting picture of the device, my blown dry hair before and my straight hair afterwards. I really like this comb better than the many other methods I have tried. I did receive the KINDOMCARES ceramic heating comb at a discount or at no charge for the purpose of providing the company with my honest and unbiased feedback. I would highly recommend it to you!!!!",5.0,2,4,en

"The only thing that holds my hair up properly — I have long, very thick hair. My hair breaks heavy-duty ponytail holders regularly. My hair laughs at barrettes and clips. Every time I've had a professional updo for a formal event, the stylist has used multiple dozens of bobby pins to hold my hair in place. And I have never been able to do an updo myself and get it to stay in place, no matter how many bobby pins I use. My hair just spits them out, and the updo falls down. I'd even tried those Magic Grip curved plastic hairpins -- people claimed those held up long hair -- and if anything, they worked worse than regular bobby pins in my hair. (And yes, I used them right, first aiming them out of the bun and then twisting them around to tuck them into the bun.)<br /><br />So I was skeptical when a friend recommended Spin Pins. I figured they would be another disappointment. But they are BRILLIANT.<br /><br />It takes four Spin Pins to hold my hair in a bun (the package instructions say to use two, but they're written for people with normal amounts of hair). I literally just screw them into the bun so that they catch some of the hair that lies against my head, along with catching the bun itself. I figured out the best technique by my second try. I promise these aren't complicated to use. The instructions have pictures.<br /><br />And once they're in, that bun stays",5.0,2,4,en

"New Technology is a step back — My old Norelco was better, more sturdy. This one is lighter - a plus - but being lighter seems to make it somewhat flimsier. Worse, despite the ""improved"" shaving heads with 50% more shaving surface, the shaving time takes much longer, which took me by surprise. I'm not sure why the longer shaving time, but I sense that the shavers spin slower than my old Norelco. It is quiet, which was important to me, and, ultimately, I do get a fairly close shave. The pop-up trimmer works fine and the recharging stand is convenient. I like the form-fitted case. The head opens too easily, so I'm forever cleaning up shaving stubble due to accidental openings. I cannot comment on the battery life, as it is still too new to see how economical the shaver is, however I can say that a full charge lasts me about a week (five shaves). Overall, I'm fairly satisfied, notwithstanding the above disappointments, but I cannot say I'm ""wowed"" by this new model over my older model.",3.0,1,2,en

"Mehhh — So the quality isn’t bad, it’s soft, no shedding seen while brushing, combing and flat ironing however I ordered an 18” and its not very flattering to me. another thing is I bought this just so I dnt have to have a leave out and unfortunately I had to a leave out because the weft are just think and sitting right on top. It looks horrible. And I’ve always wanted to try the V part because I have natural hair and didn’t want to use bundles and resort to relaxing my hair, I hate seeing people wear leave out and it doesn’t match the actual hair and I really hate frontal and closure because of the glue. So after flat ironing my leave out it blended right in with the hair and that made me happy. I’m giving this a 3 star only because the leave out worked but again as advertised I shouldn’t have had to do that. A lot of reviews I’ve seen with V part wings from other company seems to actually do what it’s supposed to do and is to give that natural look without the need for a leave out so if that’s what u are really looking for then this hair didn’t for you.

The writing on the back of the pencil is in Korean (at least I’m guessing that’s what it is since the product was made in Korea). There is English on the back that has “Pencil” just under the cap on one end, and “Brush” just under the cap on the other end. So, it’s nice each side is labeled. The pencil is triangular shaped. The spoolie is the standard spoolie. It is soft, not too scratchy.<br /><br />It glides onto the eyebrows easily. Very creamy. It has good pigment. It blends into the eyebrows well and doesn’t just blend away when you use the spoolie. I usually like micro tips because they give you hair like strokes. You can get pretty good hair like strokes using the tip of the triangle. Using the side you can fill the brows in quickly. The product lasts in my brows all day without fading or smearing.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice brow pencil.

The color matched perfectly to my natural hair and they feel exactly like my real hair. I put them in myself (which I will never do again because it was really difficult). I got two boxes, one 20” and one 22” so that I could layer the hair a bit and next time I will be purchasing 3 boxes just for a bit more volume and to blend it better.

"Thermal gel polish-YES! — I have quite a few regular nail polishes that are thermal and I love the magic of the changing colors. I really enjoy showing people how cool it looks for the polish to change color right before their eyes! Now having the option to do this with long lasting gel polish is super exciting! I swatched these colors and was able to immediately see the color difference after being under the warm lights of the led lamp so the changing is very sensitive, which is really what you want in a thermal polish. The stickers on the tops of the bottles aren't all that color accurate BUT they do give a general idea of what the colors are so you can have an idea of what you have. I did 2 coats for each color and it's a little hard to tell but some were great with 2 coats and others really could have benefited from a third. The glitter polish is really not a pretty color at all, I kind of wish it was either just a different thermal all together or they had chose different colors for it. The blue and reddish colors were the best formulas, seeming more like regular nail polish (not as thick and much smoother application).<br />The set is packaged great for gift giving. If you know anyone who really likes polish this would be great for them, keeping in mind if they don't already work with gel polishes they will need not only some type",5.0,2,4,en
"as expected, poor shade range — This is a decent cushion, from a formulation standpoint, but unfortunately I can't use it, because once again, like a lot of Korean brands, the shade range is too small. It's light-to-medium shades, and nothing else. No fair shades, and DEFINITELY no dark shades. So I naïvely got shade 1, thinking it would be pretty light, and with a lighter-coverage formula I'd be able to blend it into my neck. But this is so orange it's basically useless. If you have a fair complexion, I wouldn't recommend this. But if you do fit into the narrow band of light-to-medium skin tone, it's a fine cushion.",3.0,1,2,en

"Good Idea but Bad Performance. — I shave once every two days and decided to try M3 Power Nitro (black). It attracted my attention by innovative idea of combining regular razor with electro-vibration, thus making a hybrid.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with it at all! I don't like it for several reasons. Vibration actually is mostly reflected on a handle so I felt uncomfortable because it was making my hand too shaky and I'm 26 years old and not a drinker! It doesn't cause cuts or burns but it felt really annoying to my hand while shaving and even a few minutes later!<br /><br />Due to a better lubricator-strip it glides better, softer than regular Mach3 but shaving performance is about the same. Handle grip is OK but a bit worse than regular Mach3 because it doesn't have fully rubberized handle bottom. It can be used with Mach3 cartridges, I tested and shaved. While shaving I was concerned about not getting wet its battery compartment.<br /><br />I would rather use it as regular Mach3 razor, with vibration turned off, but would NOT buy another! Why pay more for a ""fancy"" but in fact useless/annoying vibration function if regular Mach3 does practically the same, if not better, job?!",2.0,0,1,en

Also, to those who have a bad pixie cut - Fear not! Don't get 100% remy extensions, those are $70+ each. Glue-ins are a nightmare.

The Holy Grail of Bruising Cream — I'd gone through a period of bumping into EVERYTHING ... with each bump I suffered another bruise. I say suffered because it seemed like it would take forever for the bruise to fade! I drenched myself in Royal Arnica Oil & Arnica based creams but they were slow to relieve the discoloration. It was extremely frustrating because each bruise took about 3 - 4 weeks to completely fade. THEN I read a review about Heladerm Pro Bruise Cream and decided to give it a try. I was blown away: within 2 days I could see the intensity of color was already beginning to fade! Each day I wake up to less purple color and more translucent color. I'm a believer and highly recommend this cream! It will be a staple in my medicine cabinet from now on. Thank You!!!,5.0,2,4,en

There's only a few mattes in each pallet but most of the shimmers aren't super shimmery, so you can use them in your crease ect. The really shimmery ones are more like ""toppers"" over another shade or a suttle look. These shadows blend so easily! They stay on all day yet wipe off nicely. Don't end up all over my face when I go to remove them. I have used the darker colors as a eyeliner.

"Love this product line — If you get a chance, try the Cedar wood and lavender and sage scent. I gave a 2 star on ez to spread because it's not alkaline like most deodorants. Slick. When you apply it, go slow and let your body warmth soften it up. What I like most is it doesn't take much and lasts a long time for the price. Apply slowly or let it warm up before you use.

"Favorite oil ever! — This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used, as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild. F&M is such a relaxing and rejuvenating scent to have as a body oil. I can totally understand why F&M continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.<br />After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years, I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive. So sadly I have had to go without Zum for quite a while until a friend told me I can buy it on Amazon.<br /><br />Those of you not familiar with Zum oil, let me give my two cents on why I'm sold on Zum for life!<br />The blend of oils used for Zum oil, is fantastic as well. Sweet almond, meadowfoam seed, sunflower, avocado, coconut & hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick. Great (obviously) for massage...but my fav use is for after shaving my legs. Feeling something so soothing and luxurious on my skin after a shave...well it is positively orgasmic! :)<br />Plus the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded, but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.<br />Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!",5.0,2,4,en

The cream also has a bit of a ‘lumpy’ texture in the jar, but applies smoothly and soaks into your skin as expected.

One side is textured and the other is smooth. The pads are extremely wet, as in dripping, so there's plenty of essence on them. It takes a while for my face to dry because of this. I don't detect a scent, nor is there any tingling or anything when I apply.<br /><br />These dry out my combo-oily/acne-prone/aging skin, so I must use a moisturizer after my face dries or I get that tight feeling and ""pull"" marks on my cheeks. These add no moisturization at all to my skin. The good news is these pads do tighten up the looks of my pores and are helping to keep acne at bay.<br /><br />As long as moisturizer is used after this step, I like these.",4.0,2,3,en

"WOW THIS PRODUCT IS THE TRUTH!!! — So it is 2:30AM, and instead of studying for a final. I had to write this review - aka this is about to be a review you need to read. I had been putting off using this because I was hesitant that it could be an all natural polish remover and still be amazing, but I kid you not, with everything I love, this is the BEST polish remover. There are a few components that are working to its advantage. For one, as an all natural polish remover, this not only removed my polish of off my acrylics and DIDNT burn off the acrylic nail, but it managed to do ALL OF MY NAILS WITH ONE COTTON PAD! yes you read that correctly. I took off my China Glaze Agent Lavender polish with one single cotton pad. And just for reference, I timed how long it took to remove one nail - 13 seconds so multiply that by 10 fingers and my nail polish was indeed gone in just under a minute and a half. Once again with one cotton pad (this blows my mind).<br /><br />The other thing working in this products favor is that it is not drying at ALL like acetone. The product almost feels like an oil. When I was removing the nail polish, I had oily residue on my hands but nothing gross or greasy feeling, it just felt like I had argan oil or cuticle oil on my fingers. This was exceptionally surprising",5.0,2,4,en

"*Update- Don’t do it — **UPDATE** I had originally gave this wig four stars for how great it looked after I put work into it but after wearing it for a couple of days in a row I realized that it is garbage. I could only wear it with a hat because it lost its cuteness real quick. It tangled really easily and the hair doesn’t pass for anything but what it is..synthetic. It started to resemble baby doll hair. I wouldn’t recommend. Find something else or just spend more for a human hair wig. All the work that I put into the wig to make it look good was a waste of time because the hair just doesn’t last.<br /><br />So listen! I had to do ALOT of work to this wig. Wearing straight out the bag is a no unless you’re cool with looking like Diana Ross. This wig was way too full. I had to thin it out a whole bunch. Also, I ordered a 20 inch but I’m pretty sure I got a 24 inch so I had to cut the length as well. As far as the hair line. It looks pretty natural, I didn’t need to do anything special except for baby hairs and color the inside and outside of the cap with make up so that it’ll match my scalp color.

"Great for curly hair!! — I was offered this product at a discount for an honest review. Being a huge fan of other Andre Lorent products which I'm currently using, I was excited to try this shampoo. I was a bit hesitant as I've tried another well known organ oil shampoos which have left my hair looking and feeling very greasy. First of all, it has a very nice scent. Not overbearing at all. It takes some getting use to, to not have the shampoo lather up, so keep that in mind and don't use too much product trying to get it to because it won't. I have naturally curly hair and need to condition every day. The first day I tried this shampoo, I did not condition because I wanted to see how this shampoo would work on its own. I had a difficult time with my wide comb getting through my long hair but the way it dried and looked throughout the day was fabulous! Much less frizz than usual. It is August in the Washington, D.C. area so humidity is ridiculous and by the end of these hot days my hair is usually out of control curly and frizzy! It was not after this shampoo.

This elixir helps combat aging skin, loss of collagen, loss of skin firmness, loss of skin elasticity, face wrinkles, eye wrinkles, neck wrinkles, chest wrinkles, sagging skin, dry skin, dull skin, age spots, discoloration, hyperpigmentation, acne, and mild acne scar repair.I don't have to worry about wrinkles yet, but I definitely have noticed that some of my dark spots on my face have become noticeably lighter! I also love the way it feels against my skin! It dries quickly and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. Apart from it feeling soft and smooth I could also feel my skin get slightly tighter as the elixir dried on my face. Pretty impressive if you ask me. This elixir can be used every morning before applying your makeup and every evening before going to bed. The best way I can describe the smell of the elixir to you is to describe it as smelling like witch hazel or aloe vera. Aloe is the second ingredient so I'm guessing that's it. The serum does have a very &#34;water-like&#34; consistency though. The company was very professional in addressing this concern. She simply explained that true serums do not include the emollients (oils, lubricants and thickening agents) that create the thicker, creamier texture of a traditional moisturizing lotion or cream.

"Decent face wash falls short on conditioning -- 2 out of 3 wasn't good enough for me — When I started growing my beard, I already had a good moisturizing face wash and was surreptitiously &#34;borrowing&#34; some of my g/f's hair conditioner (the kind you put in after shampooing, leave in for a couple minutes, then rinse out), which worked reasonably well to soften my beard. I wanted to upgrade to a beard-oriented product to keep the softness and help tame fly-aways (and avoid my g/f's ire), so I decided to try this, along with adding a beard brush. As a face wash/shampoo, it's fine -- it cleans well and the smell is light and neutral (pleasantly reminds me of the old-school barbershop that cut my hair when I was a kid). However, I was very disappointed by the conditioning (or lack thereof). Even after two weeks of use, my beard just wasn't as soft, and I had more fly-aways than before. I tried washing and rinsing, as well as leaving it in for a couple of minutes before rinsing, and found no difference. As a test, I used the other conditioner again after this, and softness returned, which suggests this product doesn't have sufficient quantities of the &#34;conditioning&#34; ingredients and is really more of a 2-in-1 face wash/shampoo.<br /><br />Ultimately I wanted to like this, but I found I get the same results with my normal (not-beard-oriented) moisturizing face wash + beard brush, as I do with this product + beard brush, at less than",3.0,1,2,en

"Cute Until You Wash It — First let me say that my comments are about the 4b/4c texture version of this product. I ordered and received this very tightly curled ponytail and I really liked how easily it matched my 4c hair. It's not as full as the picture at all, probably about half the fullness but it's still cute. I wore it for about 4 weeks, using the same products and care I do to my own hair. Again, no problems. I decided to order a 2nd one so that I could wear the pair together and get the fullness I wanted. Meanwhile, I decided to do a full co-wash and this thing became a tangled unmanageable mess! I spent about 2 hours un-matting it and trying to recover it. After it dried it was stretched out, very little curl definition and kind of a mess. So once again I sectioned it, deep conditioned it, and put my normal defining products in it and then that was all she wrote. Completely unsalvageable. I am so disappointed. Now I do have the 2nd one but can only wear the one so I still don't have the fullness I wanted and I pretty much know that once I wash this one that'll probably be the end of it's days. So my suggestion is to use minimal product. Try to do more of a spray wash vs a full-on wash and get as much use out of it as you can.<br /><br />I will mention however that when",2.0,0,1,en
"A good shave, but the price isn't quite right. — I have had a cool skin razor for several years and always liked it. I finally got around to replacing the heads, and the difference in shave quality was dramatic (my old blades were at least 5 years old). However, I only give this product three stars because the blade kit is expensive to replace yearly as recommended and only includes new blades, not an entire new blade assembly. I didn't expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don't use the special Nivea shave cartridges. (I want to be able to use a big cheap can of Barbasol dam***!) Manufacturers are entitled to charge what they wish for their products, but I don't have to like it.",3.0,1,2,en

"Perfect! — I am so glad I invested in these scrunchies. I have rather fine, thin hair that tends to kink/frizz overnight with the night time hot flashes.

"This works on every part of the body — The scent is not terrible, could smell better, but does go away after having it on for an hour or so. I have always been a “very sweaty” person, now going through menopause, I had been feeling absolutely disgusting with the amount of sweat I produce for absolutely no reason. Now add in the fact that I have my own cleaning business and no matter what time of year, I sweat profusely cleaning M-F three to four houses a day. Most of my clients are elderly so air conditioning barely exists and they keep their heat on approximately 80+ degrees any season but summer. I put this on my underarms, under my boobs, on the outside folds of my lady parts and even the buttcrack. Sorry for the visual 😳 I still sweat, but no longer become stinky or sour smelling. I would recommend this to anyone who sweats a lot or is simply going through menopause. The only thing I wish I had done differently was to order more than one at a time so that I don’t run out. I ran out and tried Native. My pits were dripping with sweat, became stinky and even broke out into a rash. I have tried the tangerine, this time I’m ordering the lime. Definitely give it a try.",5.0,2,4,en
Works for most wax machines! — I bought the Wonnie Wax Machine on Amazon and I jacked the pot up. I couldn’t get it clean despite anything I used so I decided to buy a new pot. This one works like a charm! I think it’s a pretty standard pot so it will fit most wax machines.,5.0,2,4,en

It does look phony without a hat or some kind of something-or-another over the part and the front, but for the price, that's doable.

"You get what you pay for (even in a razor) — If you like plugging in your shaver constantly, this is the device for you. I purchased this a little while ago and have been using it for about 2 months. It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing ""charge me"" indicator. Even when it is fully charged, it doesn't seem that powerful. I find myself going over an area over and over again and then just getting a regular razor to get the job done.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Easy to turn on and off, simply press a button.<br /><br />Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Lasts only 10-15 min max before you have to plug it in overnight to charge.<br /><br />Does do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />Save you money and buy a better shaver. If if you can't afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job.",2.0,0,1,en

"Best shampoo/conditioner for fine, greasy, damaged hair — My hair is fine in texture, prone to greasiness, and a bit damaged from coloring and styling (dry, brittle, breaks easily). I have gone through so many different hair products in the last couple of years, looking for something that works well for my hair type and texture. Verb Ghost shampoo and conditioner are far and away the best products I've tried. Within just a few days, my hair was softer, smoother, and healthier-feeling. After a few weeks of use, it still feels and looks terrific.<br /><br />Both the shampoo and conditioner are very light, yet surprisingly effective. The shampoo has a good, cleansing lather but doesn't feel drying. The conditioner is nice and light, and doesn't leave a greasy film on my hair. I shampoo, rinse, apply the conditioner, and let sit for a couple of minutes before rinsing. Normally, my hair will feel very heavy and difficult to rinse when I leave conditioner on for that long, but this rinses out cleanly yet still feels soft and well conditioned. You also need a surprisingly small amount of product -- they are super effective. My hair is definitely clean all day and doesn't get greasy by nighttime; the next morning, it's often still clean enough that I can throw it in a bun until the afternoon before really feeling the need to wash it again. I am also shedding far less hair with each wash than I have in years.",5.0,2,4,en

"Light and comfortable lashes — The eyelashes came in a nice hard case that is magnetic as well as two rose gold eyelash tweezers. The eyelashes are of three different thickness, light for everyday use, medium for maybe an after work event and full for events like weddings. The application of the eyelashes does take practice and it really helps that they have two tweezers because it is definitely needed. The eyelashes were comfortable and did not feel heavy on my eyelids. I like that I can reuse them instead of throwing them away like I would with previous glue lashes. Definitely a good buy!",5.0,2,4,en
