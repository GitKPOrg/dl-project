Deep Learning Project Repo (public repo)

READ ME
Hi 
Our team: Mark Emmenegger, Karteek PALLERLA, Sumit Mukherjee, Yupei Hu
Deep Learning Project Fall 2025

The project folder is structured similar to our assignment (data, outputs, src > model, utils, 
common_data_prep, model_llama_lora, model_openai_zero_few, Notebooks_Final).

Note: configs folder exists but we have not used it. We instead had config coded into the notebooks themselves.

The detailed instructions on how to run train/val/test is written within the notebook (.ipynb) files itself. Please check it out.
Outputs unfortunately are >1GB and couldn't be updated in the repo. 

Thanks Team!
